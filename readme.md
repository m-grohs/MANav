## MANav Browser Extension

MANav aka Manga Alternative Navigation is a Browser Extension that provides Navigational Keybindings for Previous/Next Chapter on Manga Sites that don't have this Feature by Default.

Any Site can be added/deleted to the active Site Array with the Extension Action Button.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This Extension sources it functionality from the Website it is active on.
> Working Navigational Links need to be present for it to bind the correct href's.
> There has been only one Instance so far where the Extension failed, but the Site in question
> had broken navigation and as such could not source the correct href's.
