### MANav Browser Extension

MANav aka Manga Alternative Navigation is a Browser Extension that provides Navigational Keybindings for Prev/Next Chapter on Manga Sites that dont have this Feature by default.

Any Site can be added/deleted to the active Site Array with the Extension Action Button.

#### Known Isuess

-   In background.js before the Tab is fully loaded clicking on the Button can produce the opposite result we want as it interferes with handleUpdate and handleClick Events.

#### ToDo

-   Move active Site Checks
-   Fix Event miss fires
-   Rewrite Icon Swithes

#### Previous Extension

A Previous Extension built around finding Class Names to search for Navigational Links can be found here. (Archived and not Maintained)
